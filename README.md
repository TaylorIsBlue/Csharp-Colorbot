# Csharp-Colorbot
Based off of seconb's Roblox-Colorbot, but in Csharp, because why not?

# Progress
Not finished, not working, about 10% in.

## instructions
use it the same way you would in seconb's repo, not much of a difference.
# may be outdated
If you're more interested in updates, install from the [main repo](https://github.com/Seconb/Roblox-Colorbot). This is just for fun.
